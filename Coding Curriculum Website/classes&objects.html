            <p>Programmers often like to find shortcuts so that making concepts reality doesn’t take a large amount of
                time. Often, with a little careful analysis, you can break down a large piece design into several
                smaller ideas, each interacting with each-other. Some programming languages can help you think like
                this; the Java language has several ways of implementing these thoughts.</p>
            <p>When you can clearly identify an idea as part of a larger concept, you can take some effort to separate
                it out as a Class. Classes are like miniature programs in and of themselves; they have their own
                variables, their own functions, and their own start up main method which is called when you create an
                instance of them. The syntax is slightly different, however.</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint" lang-java>
class MyClass {
  private int my_integer;
  public String my_string;
  public MyClass(int temporary_integer, String temporary_string)
  {
	this.my_integer = temporary_integer;
	this.my_string = temporary_string;
  }
  public int getInteger()
  {
	return this.my_integer;
  }
}  </pre>
            <p>Here is an example Class. You may notice the keywords <b>public</b> and <b>private</b> in this code
                snippet; they are important to know but will be covered shortly. There are three key sections of
                defining a Class.</p>
            <p>First, a set of <b>variables</b> that this Class is in control of are declared but not given value. You
                cannot give default values here, as the Class will not be processing anything at this point; you are
                essentially defining a cookie cutter base right now.</p>
            <p>The second major part of the Class definition is the <b>constructor</b> – essentially its main method,
                guaranteed to be run when an instance of this Class is created. This is essentially a function that does
                not require a return nor a type (note the lack of <b>int</b>, <b>void</b>,<i> </i>or any other type). It
                is, however, absolutely necessary that this constructor function has the same name as the Class. You can
                access and set any of the variables declared above via prefacing them with the keyword <b>this.</b>, and
                if you set up proper arguments for the constructor you can essentially configure what an instance of a
                Class will be like when creating it.</p>
            <p>The third section of the definition is a set of functions which it can call, or which can be called on it
                if you have an instance of it. In Object Oriented Programming, these are called <b>methods</b>. In this
                circumstance, there is one method – but there can be situations where you have zero methods, or where
                you have many of them. It is bad practice for your classes to have hundreds of methods, though.</p>
            <p>Now that we’ve created our class, we need to be able to use it and its handy methods elsewhere in the
                code. Here is an example extending the previous code snippet.</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint" lang-java>
MyClass class_instance = new MyClass(27, "Hello World");  </pre>
            <p>A Class is essentially an extension of the type system, which means that you can declare variables of
                type <i>MyClass</i> – which are used to store instances of this Class. Indeed, note the use of the <b>new</b>
                keyword; the variable <i>class_instance</i> is initialised with a new instance of <i>MyClass</i>. This
                uses the constructor function defined above; <i>temporary_integer</i> is set to 27, whilst <i>temporary_string</i>
                is set to “Hello World” – which in turn leads to internal variables <i>my_integer</i> and
                <i>my_string</i> being set to these values. When doing Object Oriented Programming, we call an instance
                of a Class an Object. Now, let’s try to interact with the Object. It has variables inside it, right?
                What if we try to access those variables?</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint" lang-java>
int some_integer = class_instance.my_integer; // This line will fail!
String some_string = class_instance.my_string; // Set to "Hello World"  </pre>
            <p>It turns out that although we can access the <i>my_string</i> variable through the Object, we are unable
                to read <i>my_integer</i>. Why is this? Look above at the code snippet for the Class MyClass to see what
                you think before moving on.</p>
            <p>It turns out it has to do with the keywords used when declaring elements inside the Class, <b>public</b>
                and <b>private</b>. Remember how we set <i>my_string</i> to be a <b>public String</b>, but
                <i>my_integer</i> to be a <b>private int</b>? This effectively limits how you can access one piece of
                code from other parts of it. If we wanted to set <i>some_integer</i> properly, we would instead use the
                public method available to read what is in <i>my_integer</i>.</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint" lang-java>
int some_integer = class_instance.getInteger(); // Set to 27</pre>
            <p>You might think this overcomplicates things. Surely a programmer should have full control over their
                code? Another principle of Object Oriented Programming is <b>encapsulation</b> - that each Object should
                know as little as possible about any other Object’s internal workings, meaning any change in a given
                Class should require as little code changes elsewhere as possible.</p>
            <p>The important concept is that limiting things in this way means that your code is easier to understand,
                and the less connected it is the less complicated it is to maintain at later dates. Changing how things
                work behind the scenes in class <i>MyClass</i> when adhering to these principles will not cause your
                program to need to be rewritten elsewhere.</p>
            <p>Many programmers set up a consistent interface of <b>getter methods</b> (for example, <i>getInteger()</i>)
                and <b>setter methods</b>. These examples do not show any setter methods; these can be written with
                similar principles as the constructor, but with a return type necessary. Try writing your own setter
                method for <i>my_integer</i> in <i>MyClass</i> to experiment.</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint" lang-java>
MyClass class_instance[] = new MyClass[100];
int i;
for (i = 0; i < 100; i++;)
{
	MyClass class_instance[i] = new MyClass(i, "One hundred strong.");
}  </pre>
            <p>One final fun fact: You can create as many instances of a Class as you like, as well as use them as a
                type when creating Arrays and other data structures.</p>
