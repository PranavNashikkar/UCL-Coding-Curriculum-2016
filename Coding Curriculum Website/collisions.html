            </h2>
            <p>Now we have gravity and velocity, but our square keeps trying to leave the window! Let’s try to fix that
                shall we? We’ll make a small platform for it to land on, so we don’t have to keep pressing ‘w’ to keep
                it on screen. </p>
            <p>To check for collisions, we’ll need to know the position and size of every object that we want to check
                for collisions. But to do this, we need to ensure that the objects we give a collision detection support
                the methods that we need to access these properties. How do we do this? By using interfaces.</p>
            <p>Let’s start by declaring a new interface called canCollide. Let’s add the methods which it should
                guarantee the existence of to it. We will require getX, getY, getWidth, and getHeight. These should all
                return a float and be public methods. </p>

   

  <pre class="prettyprint" lang-java>
public interface canCollide
{
  public float getX();
  public float getY();
  public float getWidth();
  public float getHeight();
}
 </pre>

            <p>We then state that SquareObject conforms to this interface by changing from:</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint" lang-java>
class SquareObject</pre>
            <p>to</p>
<pre class="prettyprint" lang-java>
class SquareObject implements canCollide</pre>
            <p>However, we then have to declare and provide implementations for these methods within the SquareObject
                class so let’s go ahead and do that:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint" lang-java>
public float getX()
  {
    return x;
  }
  public float getY()
  {
    return y;
  }
  public float getWidth()
  {
    return width;
  }
  public float getHeight()
  {
    return height;
  }</pre>
            <p>Excellent, so now our SquareObject implements the canCollide interface. But what good does that do? Well,
                we will be able to implement our collision detection methods for ANY object that conforms to this
                interface without having to worry about which type of object it is. But before we get into all that,
                let’s quickly create a Platform class for the square to interact with. </p>
            <p>What does this platform need to do? Well, it needs to have a position (x and y) as well as width and
                height. It should implement canCollide so it needs those methods as well. It should also be able to draw
                itself. But let’s make this object immune to gravity, and let’s also hold it still in position so we
                don’t need to worry about movement code. Similarly to SquareObject, let’s make its constructor able to
                set the x and y position it starts off in. Let’s also change the draw function so that it’s drawn in
                bright blue, just to make it clear where it is:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint" lang-java>
class Platform implements canCollide
{
  private float x,y, width=200,height=50;
  public Platform(float x, float y)
  {
    this.x=x;
    this.y=y;
  }
}</pre>
            <p>The canCollide methods also happen to share the implementation from SquareObject so let’s use these as
                well.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint" lang-java>
public float getX()
  {
    return x;
  }
  public float getY()
  {a
    return y;
  }
  public float getWidth()
  {
    return width;
  }
  public float getHeight()
  {
    return height;
  }
public void draw()
  {
    fill(0,0,255);
    rect(x, y, width,height);//currently the square is of a fixed size
  }</pre>
            <p>Let’s go ahead and make the platform show up on screen. Add a private variable to Controller called
                platform of type Platform:</p>
            <pre class="prettyprint" lang-java>private Platform platform;</pre>
            <p>In the constructor for Controller, let’s set the position of the platform to somewhere lower down on the
                screen such as (30,250). Don’t forget to add platform.draw() to the update() method of Controller so
                that we can actually see our beautiful platform. </p>
            <img src="Images/3_1.png" alt="Picture 3.1">
            <p>Excellent, now we can see our platform! But a collision with it doesn’t do anything…</p>


            <h2>
                <small>Extension Tasks:</small>
            </h2>

            <ul>
                <li>Try making the platform move around the screen with a move() method that Controller calls. Perhaps
                    it could always position itself to be below the square?

            </ul>

            <p>
            <h2>
                <small>Task 3.2</small>
            </h2>
            </p>
            <p>So now that we have a platform and a square that both implement canCollide, it’s on to the fun part: the
                collision detection and handling itself.
                Let’s create a class for collision detection called (you guessed it!) CollisionDetection. This needs to
                have a method that detects a collision when given two objects than implement canCollide.
                Let’s call this method collision (please forgive my lack of creativity in naming!). For now, let’s just
                have it return a Boolean value if there is a collision detected.
                There are 4 checks that have to fail for a collision to be present, so our method will check each of
                these in turn and if any fail it will return false.
            </p>
            <p>4 checks have to be carried out, and they must all fail in order for no collision to be present. </p>
            <ol>
                <li>if A left edge is to the right of B right edge, it can't be colliding</li>
                <li>if A's right edge is to the left of B's left, then it can't be colliding</li>
                <li>if A's top edge is below B's bottom, then it can't be colliding</li>
                <li> 4) if A's bottom edge is above B's top edge, then it can't be colliding.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Note: this assumes that the two colliding objects are rectangular.
                The co-ordinate system used has x,y as the top left co-ordinates of the shape
                So our code for the CollisionDetection class looks as follows:
            </p>
<pre class="prettyprint" lang-java>
  class CollisionDetection
{
  public Boolean collision(canCollide a,canCollide b)
  {
    if (a.getX() &gt; (b.getX()+b.getWidth()))
    {
      return false;
    }
    if ((a.getX()+a.getWidth())&lt;b.getX())
    {
      return false;
    }
    if (a.getY() &gt; (b.getY()+b.getHeight()))
    {
      return false;
    }
    if ((a.getY()+a.getHeight())&lt;b.getY())
    {
      return false;
    }
    return true;
  }
}</pre>
            <p>It doesn’t do anything on its own, so let’s make a new CollisionDetection instance called
                collisionDetector in the Controller class:</p>
            <pre class="prettyprint"
                 lang-java>private CollisionDetection collisionDetector=new CollisionDetection();</pre>
            <p>After the platform.draw() call in the update() method of the Controller, add another line that will check
                for a collision between the two objects and for now, let’s have it simply flash the background colour a
                horrible blue colour:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint" lang-java>if (collisionDetector.collision(square,platform))
    {
      background(0,0,255);
    }</pre>
            <p>Let’s also tone down the velocity that our square travels at to a more comfortable level. 0.4 (and -0.4)
                work quite nicely for square velocity so we could change all of the case statements inside the update()
                function of controller to take an argument of 0.4 and -0.4. But in the interests of making the code as
                modular and maintainable as possible, let’s instead create a new integer called squareVelocity
                (initialised to 0.4) and have the case statements take arguments as either positive or negative
                squareVelocity. </p>
            <img src="Images/3_2.png" alt="Picture 3.2">

            <p>Perfect (though very ugly), our collision detection code is now working. Let’s do something interesting
                with it.</p>
            <p>
            <h2>
                <small>Task 3.3</small>
            </h2>
            </p>
            <p>Now to have some fun. The coefficient of restitution determines the velocity of the object after its
                collision; the higher the number the higher the velocity remains after colliding. This value is the
                combined properties of both of the colliding objects, but for simplicity we can model this as each
                platform having a unique value attached to it. Add a new property to the Platform object called
                restitution as a float value.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint" lang-java>public Platform(float x, float y, float restitution)
  {
    this.x=x;
    this.y=y;
    this.restitution=restitution;
  }
</pre>
            <p>Also, change the object creation in the controller class to match the updated constructor and give a
                value of 0.5 for the new coefficient of restitution argument. We also need to add a method in Platform
                to get the coefficient of restitution if a collision IS detected:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint" lang-java>public float getRestCoeff()
  {
    return restitution;
  }</pre>
            <p>Just knowing that a collision is occurring isn’t enough, we need to know which side of the platform
                object A has collided on. We can do this by working out which angle our square comes in from. </p>
            <img src="Images/3_3.png" alt="Picture 3.3">
            <p>As shown above, if the square comes in at an angle between the two top/bottom corners, then it’s a
                vertical collision, otherwise it’s a horizontal collision. We then split it up further into which
                direction it’s coming from by using the co-ordinates of the centres of the two objects and working out
                where they are relative to one another. </p>
  <pre class="prettyprint" lang-java>public int getDirection(canCollide a, canCollide b)
  {
    //1,2,3,4 are possible return values corresponding to top,right,bottom,left
    if (CollisionIsVertical(a,b)) //if the collision is vertical, we have to work out if A is colliding on the top or bottom 
    {
      if (a.getY()+(a.getHeight()/2) &gt; b.getY()+(b.getHeight()/2))
      {
        return 1; //'top' collision
      }
      else
      {
        return 3; //'bottom' collision
      }
    }
    else
    {
      if (a.getX()+(a.getWidth()/2) &gt; b.getX()+(b.getWidth()/2))
      {
        return 2; //'right' collision
      }
      else
      {
        return 4; //'left' collision
      }
    }
  }
  
  private Boolean CollisionIsVertical(canCollide a, canCollide b) 
  {
    float angle = getAngle(a,b);
    //need to calculate the angles that A could travel into B at for it to be considered 'vertical' 
    float verticalAngle =(float) Math.toDegrees(Math.atan(3.0)); 
    if (Math.abs(angle)&lt;verticalAngle)
    {
      return true;
    }
    else
    {
      return false;
    }
  }
  
  private float getAngle(canCollide a,canCollide b) //this returns the int in relation to a moving into b
  {
    //this function compares their centres so we must first compute these centres of A and B
    float aCentrex = a.getX() + (0.5*a.getWidth());
    float aCentrey = a.getY() + (0.5*a.getHeight());
    float bCentrex = b.getX() + (0.5*b.getWidth());
    float bCentrey = b.getY() + (0.5*b.getHeight());
    float xDifference = aCentrex - bCentrex;
    float yDifference = aCentrey - bCentrey;
    return (float) Math.toDegrees(Math.atan(xDifference/yDifference));    
  }</pre>
            <p>Now that we can measure where and when collisions happen, let’s add a method to our canCollide interface.
                It should handle what happens when a collision is detected, and take an argument of our integer for
                collision direction, as well as the object it is colliding with :</p>
            <pre class="prettyprint" lang-java>public void handleCollide(int direction, canCollide b);</pre>
            <p>As both of our classes Platform and SquareObject implement canCollide, they must implement this method in
                some way. For the purposes of this guide, we won’t make the method in Platform do anything and leave it
                blank. </p>
            <pre class="prettyprint" lang-java>public void handleCollide(int direction, canCollide b) {}</pre>
            <p>Let’s also add our method from Platform getRestCoeff() to the canCollide interface, as all objects that
                implement canCollide will need this function to be useful. As we are only considering one coefficient of
                restitution between the objects for now, we will implement an empty method for SquareObject:</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint" lang-java>public float getRestCoeff()
  {
    return -1;
  }
</pre>
            <p>So we want the SquareObject to simulate a ‘bounce’. How do we do this? Well, we can reverse the velocity
                in the y direction and also make it go to the outside edge of the platform (so the object doesn’t look
                like it’s inside the platform). This is why we wanted to calculate the direction of the collision, so
                that we could place it in the right spot and reverse the correct velocity. We don’t just want to reverse
                the velocity though, we want it to be reduced by the coefficient of restitution to seem like a ‘real’
                collision. If it’s colliding from the top, then we want to place the SquareObject on the top of the
                platform so that it looks like it’s in the right spot, and so on and so forth for each edge. This can be
                achieved with the following code: </p>
  <pre class="prettyprint" lang-java>public void handleCollide(int direction, canCollide b)
  {
    float restCoeff = b.getRestCoeff();
    switch (direction)
    {
      case 1://'top' collision
        yVelocity=-1 * restCoeff * yVelocity;
        y = b.getY()+b.getHeight();
        break;
      case 2://'right' collision
        xVelocity = -1 * restCoeff * xVelocity;
        x = b.getX()+b.getWidth();
        break;
      case 3: //'bottom' collision
        yVelocity=-1 * restCoeff * yVelocity;
        y = (b.getY())-height;
        break;
      case 4://'left' collision  
        xVelocity = -1 * restCoeff * xVelocity;
        x = b.getX()-width;
        break;       
    }   
  }</pre>
            <p>We’re nearly there! We just need to call our collision code if a collision is actually detected. In the
                main controller, change the if collision detected block to get the direction from the collisionDetector
                object, then call the square’s handleCollide method with the direction and object that it’s colliding
                with (our beautiful platform). Make sure this block is run before both objects are drawn (but after
                square updates) so that you never have to see the half-collided square, just the bounce. </p>
  <pre class="prettyprint" lang-java>if (collisionDetector.collision(square,platform))
    {
      int direction = collisionDetector.getDirection(square,platform);
      square.handleCollide(direction,platform);
    }</pre>
