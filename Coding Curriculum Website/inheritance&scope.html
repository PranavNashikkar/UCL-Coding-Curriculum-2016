            <p>When engaging in Object Oriented Programming, classes are not merely for organising subsections of code –
                they also allow you to reuse code you have already written for new purposes.</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint" lang-java>
class Dog {
    private int happiness;
    private String name;
    public Dog(String new_name)
    {
        this.happiness = 1;
        this.name = new_name;
    }
    public int petMe()
    {
        System.out.print("Woof!\n");
        return ++happiness;
    }
    public void bark()
    {
        System.out.print("Bark!\n");
    }
    public void roll()
    {
        System.out.print("The dog rolls in something. Somebody needs a bath!\n");
    }
}  </pre>
            <p>Consider the case of the humble dog. Dogs have happiness which they show back to you (here represented in
                integer format), they have a name, they bark, they roll, and they can be petted. But say if you wanted a
                specific type of dog… We COULD create an entirely new class from scratch which had the same few methods,
                but there’s a better way by taking advantage of a feature of Object Oriented Programming called <b>Inheritance</b>.
            </p>
  <pre class="prettyprint" lang-java>
class Pomeranian extends Dog {
    private int fluffiness;
    public Pomeranian(String new_name)
    {
        super(new_name); // For the constructor, this needs to come first.
        this.fluffiness = 1;
    }
    public void bark()
    {
        System.out.print("Yip!\n");
    }
    public int petMe(int tussle_amount)
    {
        System.out.print("You tussle the pomeranian's floofy fluff!\n");
        this.fluffiness += tussle_amount;
        return super.petMe();
    }
    public void doTrick()
    {
        System.out.print("This is such a well-trained breed.\n");
        System.out.print("Just kidding. The pomeranian falls asleep.\n");
    }
}  </pre>
            <p>For now, let’s look at the first line. We are declaring a new class called <i>Pomeranian</i> that <b>extends</b>
                the <i>Dog</i> class. (If you don’t know what a Pomeranian looks like, drop everything and spend the
                rest of today’s class Ask Jeeves-ing or however kids internet-search these days for pictures of them.)
                Inheritance means that you have access to all of the parent methods without needing to implement them
                again.</p>
            <p>In this instance, the Pomeranian class directly uses the parent <i>Dog</i>’s <i>roll()</i> method, <b>overrides</b>
                <i>bark()</i>, has an <b>overloaded</b> <i>petMe(int)</i> method and has a new <i>doTrick()</i> method.
                In addition, it has its own constructor method. Both the constructor and the overloaded
                <i>petMe(int) </i>call <b>super</b> methods. This is a lot to take in, so we’ll go through this step by
                step.</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint" lang-java>
public Pomeranian(String new_name)
{
    super(new_name); // For the constructor, this needs to come first.
    this.fluffiness = 1;
}  </pre>
            <p>You notice the first line of the constructor method, right? This initialises everything about class <i>Pomeranian</i>
                that is shared with class <i>Dog</i> – in this case, the <i>happiness</i> and <i>name</i> fields. If you
                think the comment is a little weird, you would be right; it’s a quirk of Java that the <b>super</b> call
                needs to come first in the constructor.</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint" lang-java>
public void bark()
{
    System.out.print("Yip!\n");
}  </pre>
            <p>We say that <i>Pomeranian</i>’s <i>bark()</i> <b>overrides</b><i> Dog</i>’s <i>bark()</i>, which means
                that it is effectively replaced for class <i>Pomeranian</i>. This is not exactly a bark, due to its
                different onomatopoeia; this is the fault of the original implementation of class<i> Dog</i> for
                attempting to class a wide variety of excited noises across many breeds under a single all-encompassing
                name. A better name – if we were redesigning the parent class – would be something like <i>showExcitedness()</i>…
                but this is besides the point. With Object Oriented Programming, there is a danger of making your code
                hard to understand if you override without being careful about whether your new functionality is a valid
                replacement.</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint" lang-java>
public int petMe(int tussle_amount)
{
    System.out.print("You tussle the pomeranian's floofy fluff!\n");
    this.fluffiness += tussle_amount;
    return super.petMe();
}  </pre>
            <p>You might be forgiven for thinking the above was another instance of <b>overriding</b>… but this actually
                demonstrates a completely different phenomenon which is also useful to know. As you can see, this <i>petMe(int)</i>
                method has an <b>int</b> argument – but the method <i>petMe()</i> in the <i>Dog</i> class does not. This
                is known as <b>overloading</b>, which is more generally creating multiple methods with the same name but
                different arguments and behaviour. The <i>petMe()</i> without an argument from the superclass is still
                accessible through Pomeranian, as well. This also demonstrates another usage of the <b>super</b>
                keyword, showing that there are no limitations on when you can call public super methods.</p>
            <p><i>doTrick()</i> is nothing special. It’s a new public method which is available only to the subclass and
                not the superclass and is barely worth the start of this paragraph. In addition, <i>roll()</i> is not
                overridden and is directly accessible via the subclass. These are the trivial parts of inheritance, and
                are not to be worried about. There are some things which need to be taken seriously, however.</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint" lang-java>
class Chihuahua extends Dog {
    public Chiuaua(String new_name)
    {
        super(new_name);
    }
    public void bark()
    {
        System.out.print("Yap!\n");
        this.happiness++; // This line will cause the program to fail.
    }
}  </pre>
            <p>This is a <i>Chihuahua</i>; they go nuts just on their own, even without human interaction. This is
                modelled via <i>overriding</i> the <b>bark()</b> method to increment happiness. The parent class has
                happiness, right? Unfortunately, it turns out this causes the program to fail, as the Chihuahua does not
                actually have access to its happiness attribute. Why is this the case? Let’s look all the way back to
                class Dog…</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint" lang-java>
class Dog {
    private int happiness;
    . . .</pre>
            <p>Oh, this is why. The <i>happiness</i> variable is a <b>private int</b>! But… wait, <b>private</b> is
                supposed to mean that the variable is inaccessible from outside class <i>Dog</i>, like from its owner.
                Why can’t a specific type of <i>Dog</i> access it? It turns out this is another instance of
                encapsulation limiting what we are able to do with the variable. (Remember that it doesn’t need to be a
                variable specifically, though – it could just as easily be a method – or even a constructor, but that is
                beyond the scope of this tutorial.)</p>
            <p>If we want to be able to access <i>happiness</i> from the subclass, we need to make a change to the
                superclass. The simplest way is outlined below.</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint" lang-java>
class Dog {
    protected int happiness;
    . . .</pre>
            <p>By changing the <b>private</b> variable to a <b>protected</b> variable, we make it directly accessible to
                the inherited classes without allowing it to be accessible externally. However, there is a downside in
                that it makes the implementation specifics of the Dog superclass directly relevant to its subclasses.
                This means that if we were to rewrite <i>Dog</i>, we’d have to alter <i>Chihuahua</i> to match.</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint" lang-java>
class Dog {
    private int happiness;
    . . .
    protected void changeHappiness(int amount)
    {
        this.happiness += amount;
    }
    . . .</pre>
  <pre class="prettyprint" lang-java>
class Chihuahua extends Dog {
    . . .
    public void bark()
    {
        System.out.print("Yap!\n");
        changeHappiness(1); // This is allowed now.
    }
}</pre>
            <p>This is a more flexible long-term solution; by keeping happiness <b>private</b> but providing a <b>protected</b>
                method, any change to how happiness is stored in <i>Dog</i> wouldn’t require a rewrite of
                <i>Chihuahua</i>.</p>
            <p>One exercise for the reader is to consider a class that <i>Dog</i> would inherit from in the first place.
                Is it a type of <i>Wolf</i>? Or is it a <i>Mammal</i> in general? Perhaps it might be a <i>Pet</i> –
                although considering the next chapter, it would probably be wiser to handle a set of <i>Pet</i>-appropriate
                methods differently…</p>
