            <p>OK now for the fun part, it’s time to use processing! So what is processing? Processing is based on the
                Java language you have been using so far, with a lot of useful features to make it easier to do visual
                things such as drawing games. </p>
            <p>If you make a new processing file, it’ll be blank. There are two methods that are commonly used within
                processing, and those are void draw() and void setup(). Everything inside the setup method is ran once
                right at the start of the program. This is useful for setting up any features that need you to make sure
                the program runs smoothly. Go ahead and write the following program:</p>

            <h2>
                <small>Task 1.1</small>
            </h2>

  <pre class="prettyprint" lang-java>
void setup(){
  size(500,500);
  background(255,0,0);
}  </pre>

            <p>So what is this doing? Well, the setup() runs only once, so not a great amount. It tells processing that
                we want a window size of width 500 pixels and height 500 pixels. It then sets the background colour to a
                very bright red. The background function is overloaded so it can be called in many different ways. If
                you call it with one parameter, it uses a grayscale colour. If you declare it with 3 as we have done
                then it uses red, green and blue values from 0-255 respectively to declare a colour. Because we have set
                red to max and green and blue to 0, the screen is a bright red.</p>

            <h2>
                <small>Extension Tasks:</small>
            </h2>

            <ul>
                <li>Investigate more about pixels and how screen resolutions work, and try changing the window size to

                <li>Investigate more about how RGB (red green blue) colour values work and try changing these values to
                    see what happens.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <img src="Images/1_1.png" alt="Picture 1.1">

            <p>
            <h2>
                <small>Task 1.2</small>
            </h2>
            </p>
            <p>OK so that’s not a very interesting program you say? Fine, let’s make something actually happen. First,
                we should get some input from the user. To do this, let’s make an input object so that we can just call
                the methods every time we need it. Let’s use the asdw keys as input to make something move left down
                right and up respectively. Processing has a globally accessible inbuilt variable called ‘key’ which
                stores the last key pressed as a character. It also has a variable called ‘keyPressed’ which is a
                Boolean that is true if any key on the keyboard is pressed. We want to check if one of the keys we care
                about is being pressed, and we will do this using an if statement to check if key is either a,w,s or d
                and also if the keyPressed is currently true (so the key is actually being pressed at that moment). Add
                the following code to your program: </p>

  <pre class="prettyprint" lang-java>
class InputKey
{
  public boolean keyAvailable()
  {
    if ((key=='a'||key=='w'||key=='s'||key=='d')&&keyPressed)
    {
      return true;
    }
    else
    {
      return false;
    }
  }
}</pre>

            <p>OK, so using this class we can check if a,s,d or w is being pressed. Let’s make another class to
                represent something moving around the screen. Let’s call this class a SquareObject. It should hold 4
                variables internally, representing x,y and the width of the height of the object. These should be
                private to the object, to maintain encapsulation. </p>
            <img src="Images/1_2.png" alt="Picture 1.2">
            <p>Image source: http://programarcadegames.com/chapters/05_intro_to_graphics/Computer_coordinates_2D.png</p>
            <p>
                We should use a constructor to set the initial position (x,y) of this square:
            </p>
<pre class="prettyprint" lang-java>
private float x,y;
  private float width=50,height=50;
  public SquareObject(float x,float y)
  {
    this.x=x;
    this.y=y;
  }</pre>
            <p>So which methods does this square need? We need it to be able to change its x and y co-ordinates if we
                want it to move, so let’s implement changeX and changeY methods to allow this to happen. They should
                take a float as a parameter so that they are able to change X and Y by anything using positive or
                negative values. We should also declare a void draw() method for the square to draw itself, as this
                should be the responsibility of the square not any other object according to good OOP principles. </p>
<pre class="prettyprint" lang-java>
public void changeX(float distance)
  {
    x+=distance;
  }
  public void changeY(float distance)
  {
    y+=distance;
  }
  public void draw()
  {
    fill(100,30,1);
    rect(x, y, width,height);
  }  
</pre>
            <p>Let us also create a Controller class that is responsible for updating all of the logic. This way, we can
                ensure that we don’t pollute namespaces by having global variables, and it is also a good abstraction to
                have in general. Let us use its constructor to make an InputKey object as well as a SquareObject object
                which will be stored inside a global Controller object.
                Controller controller new Controller(); should be declared right at the top, outside of any method so
                that it is global. Your Controller class should look something like this:
            </p>
<pre class="prettyprint" lang-java>
class Controller
{
  private InputKey inputKey;
  private SquareObject square;
  public Controller()
  {
    inputKey=new InputKey();
    square = new SquareObject(30,30);
  }
}</pre>
            <p>We should also create an update method for the controller for it to run every time draw calls it, which
                will update the simulation logic. So what do we want this to do? Let’s make it get a key and change the
                x or y value of the square based on which key was pressed. Let’s also make it draw the square so we can
                actually see what is happening. It should also first set the background again, to clear the screen and
                ensure the background is properly set. Let’s use an if statement to see if any of the right keys are
                being pressed, and use a switch statement to make the square move based on which key is pressed:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint" lang-java>
public void update()
  {
    background(255,0,0);
    if (inputKey.keyAvailable())
    {
      switch(key)
      {
        case 'a':
          square.changeX(-1);
          break;
        case 's':
          square.changeY(1);
          break;
        case 'd':
          square.changeX(1);
          break;
        case 'w':
          square.changeY(-1);
          break;
      }
    }
    square.draw();    
  }
</pre>
            <p>And finally, let’s make our draw method call controller.update():</p>
<pre class="prettyprint" lang-java>
void draw()
{
  controller.update();
}</pre>
            <img src="Images/1_3.png" alt="Picture 1.3">
            <p>Success! We have a square that we can move around the screen using the asdw keys!</p>
